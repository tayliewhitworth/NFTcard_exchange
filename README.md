# NFTcard_exchange
This is an app made in React Native that allows people to buy NFT cards. 
It is a UI design app so there I haven't connected an API yet. I published it on expo with a working link. 
Here is the link to check out the app! Download the expo app to access:

I followed a tutorial by JSMastery to learn the basics.
